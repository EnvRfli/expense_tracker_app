# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented biometric authentication with PIN fallback for the expense tracker app. This provides a secure way to protect user data with multiple authentication options.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Updated UserModel** 
- Added `pinCode` field (stores hashed PIN)
- Added `pinEnabled` field (tracks if PIN is active)
- Updated all related methods (toJson, fromJson, copyWith)
- Regenerated Hive type adapters

### 2. **Created AuthService** (`lib/services/auth_service.dart`)
- Handles biometric authentication using `local_auth` package
- Manages PIN hashing using SHA-256 encryption
- Implements app lock/unlock mechanism
- Manages authentication timeouts and preferences
- **Key Methods:**
  - `isBiometricAvailable()` - Checks device biometric support
  - `authenticateWithBiometric()` - Performs biometric authentication
  - `verifyPin()` - Validates PIN input
  - `getHashedPin()` - Securely hashes PIN for storage
  - `isAppLocked()` - Checks if app should be locked
  - `setAppBackgrounded()` - Tracks when app goes to background

### 3. **Created PIN Setup Screen** (`lib/screens/pin_setup_screen.dart`)
- Beautiful numeric keypad interface
- PIN confirmation process
- Support for both new PIN creation and PIN editing
- Visual feedback with pin dots
- Error handling and validation

### 4. **Created PIN Entry Screen** (`lib/screens/pin_entry_screen.dart`)
- Secure PIN entry interface
- Automatic biometric prompt on load
- Attempt limiting (max 5 attempts)
- Fallback to biometric option
- Visual error feedback

### 5. **Created App Lock Wrapper** (`lib/widgets/app_lock_wrapper.dart`)
- Automatically manages app locking/unlocking
- Monitors app lifecycle (background/foreground)
- Shows authentication screen when needed
- Integrates with main app flow

### 6. **Enhanced Settings Screen**
- Added PIN management tile in Security section
- Enhanced biometric tile with proper validation
- PIN setup, edit, and removal options
- Biometric availability checking
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 7. **Updated UserSettingsProvider**
- Added PIN-related getters (`pinCode`, `pinEnabled`)
- Added `updatePinSettings()` method
- Updated export/import to include PIN data
- Updated reset functionality to clear PIN

## Security Features

### **PIN Security**
- Uses SHA-256 hashing for PIN storage
- 4-6 digit PIN support
- No plain text PIN storage
- Attempt limiting to prevent brute force

### **Biometric Security**
- Fingerprint and face recognition support
- Device capability checking
- Graceful fallback to PIN when biometric fails
- User preference management

### **App Lock Mechanism**
- Automatic locking when app goes to background
- Configurable lock timeout
- Secure session management
- Lifecycle-aware locking

## User Experience

### **Setup Flow**
1. User goes to Settings > Security
2. Can enable biometric authentication (tests device capability)
3. Can setup PIN as fallback or primary authentication
4. Both can be enabled simultaneously

### **Authentication Flow**
1. When app is locked, shows authentication screen
2. Tries biometric first (if enabled and available)
3. Shows PIN keypad as fallback
4. Unlocks app on successful authentication

### **Management**
- Easy PIN change through settings
- PIN removal option
- Biometric toggle with device checking
- Reset all security settings option

## Technical Integration

### **Added Dependencies**
- `crypto: ^3.0.3` - For PIN hashing
- Uses existing `local_auth: ^2.1.8` - For biometric authentication
- Uses existing `shared_preferences: ^2.2.2` - For lock state management

### **Main App Integration**
- Wrapped `SplashScreen` with `AppLockWrapper` in `main.dart`
- Authentication is checked on app resume
- Seamless integration with existing app flow

## Files Created/Modified

### **New Files:**
- `lib/services/auth_service.dart`
- `lib/screens/pin_setup_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/pin_entry_screen.dart`
- `lib/widgets/app_lock_wrapper.dart`

### **Modified Files:**
- `lib/models/user.dart` - Added PIN fields
- `lib/providers/user_settings_provider.dart` - Added PIN methods
- `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` - Enhanced security section
- `lib/services/services.dart` - Added auth service export
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added crypto dependency
- `lib/main.dart` - Integrated app lock wrapper

## Usage Instructions

### **For Users:**
1. **Enable Biometric:** Go to Settings > Security > Toggle "Autentikasi Biometrik"
2. **Setup PIN:** Go to Settings > Security > Tap "PIN Keamanan" > Enter 4-6 digit PIN
3. **Change PIN:** Go to Settings > Security > Tap edit icon next to PIN
4. **Remove PIN:** Go to Settings > Security > Tap delete icon next to PIN

### **For Developers:**
- Authentication state is managed automatically
- App lock wrapper handles all authentication flows
- PIN is stored securely as SHA-256 hash
- Biometric preferences are saved in SharedPreferences
- Lock timeout can be configured via AuthService

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **No Plain Text Storage** - PIN is always hashed
2. **Attempt Limiting** - Prevents brute force attacks
3. **Device Capability Checking** - Only enables features when supported
4. **Graceful Fallbacks** - Multiple authentication options
5. **Session Management** - Proper lock/unlock lifecycle
6. **Data Validation** - All inputs are validated
7. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error management

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Configurable lock timeout in settings
- Pattern lock as additional option
- Advanced biometric settings
- Authentication logs/history
- Recovery options for forgotten PIN

The implementation provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly authentication system that protects user financial data while maintaining ease of use.
