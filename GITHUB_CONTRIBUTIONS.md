# 📊 GitHub Contributions Fix - Solo Developer

## 🎯 Problem
Commits ke branch `develop` tidak muncul di GitHub contributions graph.

## ✅ Solution Options

### **Option 1: Change Default Branch to `develop`**

**Steps:**
1. Go to GitHub repo: `https://github.com/EnvRfli/expense_tracker_app`
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to **Default branch** section
4. Change from `main` to `develop`
5. Click **Update**

**Result:**
- ✅ All your daily commits to `develop` will count as contributions
- ✅ Keep `main` for stable releases only
- ✅ Perfect for solo development

### **Option 2: Regular Merge to Main**

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Every week or when significant progress
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main

# Back to develop
git checkout develop
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Contributions show up when merged to main
- ❌ Less frequent contribution activity

### **Option 3: Work Directly on Main (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Work directly on main
git checkout main
# Make changes...
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin main
```

**Result:**
- ✅ All commits count as contributions
- ❌ Less organized development
- ❌ No separation between stable/development

## 🎯 Recommendation for Solo Developer

**Use Option 1: Change default branch to `develop`**

**Why:**
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ Daily commits count as contributions
- ✅ Still organized with stable releases on `main`
- ✅ Professional workflow maintained

## 🔧 Current Setup

- **Current Default**: `main`
- **Development Branch**: `develop`
- **Recommendation**: Change default to `develop`

---
**After changing default branch, all your daily commits will show up in contributions graph! 🎉**
